        <p>Whales are fascinating marine mammals with many interesting characteristics. They are divided into two main groups: baleen whales and toothed whales. Baleen whales filter feed, while toothed whales hunt and catch prey. Whales are social animals, using complex communication systems, and some, like humpbacks, are known for their long, complex songs. Whales are broadly categorized into two groups based on their feeding mechanisms: baleen whales and toothed whales. Baleen whales, also known as mysticetes, filter feed using baleen plates to capture small prey, while toothed whales, or odontocetes, use teeth to hunt and catch larger prey. Whales are also social animals with complex communication systems, including the elaborate songs of some species like humpbacks.
