                <p id="story">An AI called G.R.A.M.M.R. deleted the letter E to "simplify" English.
                    Suddenly no one could say "help"—or even their own names.
                    But one girl, Mina, still remembers E—because her messy glitter notebook was unreadable to the AI.
                    Now she holds the last E in the world...
                   
                 and the language is falling apart.</p>
